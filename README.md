# LeetCode

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. I am documenting my journey and progress as I practice coding and algorithm skills by solving these questions. Each solution is implemented in Python and is organized by problem category.

## Structure

- **Algorithms**: Solutions to algorithm-based questions.
- **Data Structures**: Problems focused on specific data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to problems requiring dynamic programming approaches.
- **Graph Theory**: Solutions for graph-related questions.

## Goals

- Enhance problem-solving skills.
- Improve coding efficiency and knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
- Practice for coding interviews.
